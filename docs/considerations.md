- Always sort tags alphabetically
	- Maybe also by NSFW

	- All values of a list must be supplied
	- All values not supplied are left as-is
	- Sanity checks are always executed

	- ID's can not be modified
- both `enctype` (for everything) and `encoding` should be set to `multipart/form-data` on the no-script upload page
